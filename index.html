                    <li>Many of the studies on the association of iron status in early childhood and psychomotor and behavioral development do not differentiate between iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency <em>(Murray-Kolb L, 2013).
</em></li><li>Although we know that iron is a good part of the proteins that are responsible for the transport of oxygen, hemoglobin and myoglobin, a small but important percentage of iron is part of other enzymes and key compounds. This is a mineral content in enzymes that participate in the synthesis of lipids that, in turn, are for cell membranes and for the synthesis of honey in the brain and therefore, cognitive and motor functions become negatively before a problem myelination <em>(Murray-Kolb LE, 2013).
</em></li><li>Iron is also part of the metabolic processes of neurotransmitters mainly dopaminergic and serotoninergic that would have an impact on behavior. All these processes are related to the hippocampus, the brain region and learning and memory, as well as affective behaviors such as depression and anxiety.</li>

                    <li>In children who suffered from anemia due to iron deficiency in their first year of life and that was later corrected by iron supplementation, it was found that, after 10 years of follow-up, they had longer reaction times and a lower ability to control impulsive responses. , what is called inhibitory control <em>(Algarín, Nelson, Peirano, Westerlund, Reyes and Lozoff, 2013)</em>. This difficulty is one of the behavioral deficits that is related to disorders such as attention deficit and hyperactivity, among others.
</li><li>Frongillo et al. (2014) mention that: "socio-emotional behavior is another area of ​​child development, and includes the establishment of relationships with other people using their emotions, as well as the regulation of himself and his interest to the outside" <em>(page 68- 88).
</em></li><li>These inappropriate behaviors and behavioral problems have an impact on home, school and work.
</li><li>On the other hand, a study in China found that low levels of hemoglobin in four-year-old children were associated with problems of externalized behavior at age 6, an association that was not affected by problems of social adversity. There was also a difference according to sex in the behavioral manifestation at six years, children had more attention problems, while girls had greater aggression. This study has some limitations such as the small sample size, reports only low levels of hemoglobin and not anemia, and does not mention other measures that assess malnutrition such as weight and height. Among the limitations of the systematic reviews we can mention that they combined many types of evaluations (mental and motor), others did not consider the age difference, nor the instruments with which the mental or motor development was evaluated.
</li><li>For several decades it has been known that iron deficiency negatively impacts psychomotor and behavioral performance. Some studies suggest that these effects could have a long-term impact, that it is not possible to reverse despite having overcome anemia, however, there is no consensus on this and more research is required (Su, Cui, Zhou, Ai, Sun and Zhao, 2016).</li>

                                <p class="block-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Many of the studies on the association of iron status in early childhood and psychomotor and behavioral development do not differentiate between iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency (Murray-Kolb L, 2013).
<br><br>Although we know that iron is a good part of the proteins that are responsible for the transport of oxygen, hemoglobin and myoglobin, a small but important percentage of iron is part of other enzymes and key compounds. This is a mineral content in enzymes that participate in the synthesis of lipids that, in turn, are for cell membranes and for the synthesis of honey in the brain and therefore, cognitive and motor functions become negatively before a problem myelination (Murray-Kolb LE, 2013).
<br><br>Iron is also part of the metabolic processes of neurotransmitters mainly dopaminergic and serotoninergic that would have an impact on behavior. All these processes are related to the hippocampus, the brain region and learning and memory, as well as affective behaviors such as depression and anxiety.</p>
