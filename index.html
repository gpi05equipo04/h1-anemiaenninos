It should be noted that motor development is important to subsequently execute reading and writing functions, which involve both cognitive and motor areas.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <li><strong>IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT:</strong>&nbsp;Many of the studies on the association of iron status in early childhood and psychomotor and behavioral development, do not differentiate between iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency.
 Although we know that most body iron is part of two proteins that are responsible for the transport of oxygen, hemoglobin and myoglobin, a small but important percentage of iron is part of other enzymes and key compounds. This is a mineral contained in enzymes that participate in the synthesis of lipids that, in turn, are an input for cell membranes and for the synthesis of myelin in the brain and therefore, cognitive and motor functions are negatively affected by a problem in myelination.</li><li><strong>IN MENTAL DEVELOPMENT: </strong><em>Frongillo, Tofail, Hamadani, Warren, Mehrin (2014)</em> mention that:
 <strong>"</strong>The mental or cognitive development includes functions of execution of the thought, memory, reasoning, attention, visual processing, as well as solution of problems<strong>"</strong>. <strong>(pages 68-88). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong><strong>Anemia in early childhood minimizes the cognitive abilities of infants</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><em>(Grantham and Ani, 2001) (Sachdev, Gera and Nestel, 2005) (Szajewska, Ruszcynski and Chmielewska, 2010). &nbsp;</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The meta-analysis, previously mentioned in 2010, has fewer methodological limitations. Based on a systematic review of 2014, it is known that both iron deficiency and anemia with or without iron deficiency cause cognitive deficit </span><em>(Jáuregui, 2014).</em></li><li><strong>IN BEHAVIOR:</strong> <span style="font-size: 1rem;"><em>Frongillo, Tofail, Hamadani, Warren, Mehrin (2014) </em>mention that: <strong>"</strong>Social-emotional behavior is another area of ​​child development, and includes the establishment of relationships with other people who use their emotions, as well as the regulation of self and his interest towards the outside world<strong>"</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(pages 68-88). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></span><strong>These behavioral and behavioral problems have an impact on home, school and work.</strong></li>
